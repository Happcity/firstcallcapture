                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    At Blue Belfry Business Solutions, we believe every customer interaction matters. We built First Call Capture to help small businesses never miss an opportunity to connect with their customers.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    When you're busy running your business, you can't always answer every call. But your customers deserve to know you care. That's why we created an automated system that instantly responds to missed calls with a personalized text message, keeping your leads warm until you can call them back.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why We Started</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    We understand the challenges small business owners face because we've been there. Running a business means wearing many hats, and sometimes that means missing important calls from customers who need your services right now.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Studies show that 80% of callers won't leave a voicemail, and most will simply call your competitor instead. We knew there had to be a better way - one that's affordable, easy to use, and actually works.
