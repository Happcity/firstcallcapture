                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        When someone calls your business phone and you can't answer, First Call Capture automatically sends them a personalized text message within seconds. The message lets them know you received their call and will get back to them soon. You can customize this message to match your brand and business needs.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How long does setup take?</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Setup takes less than 5 minutes! Simply sign up, choose your plan, and we'll provide you with a dedicated phone number. Forward your missed calls to this number (we'll show you how), customize your auto-reply message, and you're ready to go. No technical knowledge required.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        No! You keep your existing business phone number. We provide you with a dedicated forwarding number that you'll use to forward only your missed calls. Your customers will never see or interact with this forwarding number - they only see your regular business number.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Absolutely! You have complete control over your auto-reply message. Include your business name, hours of operation, website link, or any other information you want. You can also include your callback number so customers can easily call you back with one tap. Update your message anytime through your dashboard.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Text messages are sent within 2-5 seconds after a missed call. Our system is built on Twilio's industry-leading infrastructure to ensure reliable, fast delivery. The exact timing may vary slightly based on the caller's mobile carrier.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Each subscription plan includes one dedicated phone number. If you need multiple numbers (for different locations, departments, or businesses), you can subscribe to additional plans. Each plan operates independently with its own settings and analytics.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        If a caller leaves a voicemail on your regular business line before the call forwards to First Call Capture, they'll still receive the auto-reply text. This ensures every caller gets acknowledgment, whether they leave a voicemail or not.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Yes! Callers can reply to the text message. You'll receive an SMS notification with their response, and you can continue the conversation via text or call them back directly. This creates a seamless two-way communication channel with your customers.
